Introduction 
This proposal outlines Cyberquackâ€™s plan to introduce a Managed Detection Response (MDR) solution for the ongoing monitoring, threat hunting, and incident response services required by the City of New Westminster's cyber security program. This plan includes the use of a next-generation Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) platform, paired with a proactive approach to vulnerability testing, incident response, and regularly available reports.
Next-Generation EDR Implementation
The City's systems, devices, and cloud solutions are under threat from the continually evolving cyber landscape. With the average time-to-detect (TTD) a threat lasting around 277 days, an effective EDR solution is imperative to mitigating the risk to the City of New Westminster. A major issue that faces any organization implementing an EDR solution is the manpower to design, deploy, test, and maintain the security apparatus. 
Our firm has extensive experience, particularly in municipal applications, of building mature and thorough threat detection and response models that have proven themselves against modern threat actors. By investing in our managed EDR solution, resources, and staff fatigue traditionally experienced by in-house security teams are reduced and City employees can focus on the exceptional roles they already play in our society.
Transitioning To Zero Trust Architecture
Traditional security paradigms, akin to a castle behind a moat, are inadequate for modern threats. The solution is a shift in thinking. Adopting a zero-trust model is imperative for the City of New Westminster, focusing on principles like least privilege, microsegmentation, and multi-factor authentication to continuously verify identity and privilege on the network, both internally and externally.

Hunting For Threats Before Threat Actors
With our proposed defensive MDR solution, proactive threat hunting through vulnerability testing will provide meaningful action items that will further strengthen the security of the City's infrastructure. Functional dashboards allow city officials to witness threats as they are discovered, offering the ability to see the attacker before they see you.
Regular reporting on a weekly schedule real-time alerts that follow BC-IM/IT and other industry standards work to ensure continuous monitoring strategies that leverage the reach and depth of the EDR solution. Incident response strategies, combining AI automation with human oversight, are tailored in collaboration with City security professionals.
