How will the project proceed?



What will we need from the customer to move forward?

We will need to work with City officials to conduct an infastructure inventory. This will clearly define the scope of our EDR solution. During this we will gather any existing documentation available, and create topology maps to fully understand the overall network structure. We will also collaborate with key personnel to define which assets and components will need to be included. 

How is the project going to be managed?

What is the very first thing that needs to be done? The second? The third? After that?
The first order of business is to meet with City officials and debrief on the current security posture of the organization. Once City officials have outlined their posture, the system will be assessed via vulnerability scanning to establish what vulnerabilities can be mitigated with the EDR solution and what vulnerabilities that need to be addressed outside the EDR solution.
Once these vulnerabilities have been categorized, the EDR solution will be implemented alongside an employee training program that educates end-device users on the role they play securing the networks that they use. Vulnerabilities not resolved with the EDR solution will be addressed with City officials to clarify responsibilities and scope in order to further strengthen the security posture of the City. 
After implementation, the EDR solution will develop its managed service by first developing the baseline of normal network behavior for end-devices, systems, and cloud applications. Telemetry from this data will be bundled into a dashboard that will leverage security platforms already in place in City infrastructure, creating a real-time analytics dashboard that can be accessed by City security officials and planners.
Once all known vulnerabilities in the system architecture have been addressed and resolved via EDR or City security officials, our firm will begin focusing on developing a periodic penetration testing framework. The firm’s in-house Red Team specializes in offensive security testing enterprise-level networks, and have a multitude of purpose-built tools that will continue to test the attack surface of the City of New Westminster’s IT networks. With regular meetings and reporting, this value-added service has the potential to stop threat actors before they discover weaknesses in the system.

Specifically what tools and methods will be used in this project?

Using Crowdstrike’s latest EDR innovation, the City of New Westminster can rest assured their networks have a guardian angel always watching over them. Crowdstrike’s Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration powers the EDR with real-time updates on modern tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and can identify even the stealthiest of attackers, creating something like a TV’s DVR on every network endpoint. Using the Falcon platform, this recorded intelligence can be accessed from and calculated in the cloud, allowing ultimate visibility from anywhere in the world.
To compliment the EDR solution, a management team of highly skilled network engineers, security analysts, and system administrators take security to the next level. Through our highly skilled management team, the EDR solution becomes an MDR solution that not only detects, but proactively hunts, investigates, and responds to emerging or advanced threats. Our in-house security team will work closely with our Red Team pentesters to develop a threat database based on behavior, EDR artificial intelligence (AI) insights, and cutting edge industry insider knowledge.
