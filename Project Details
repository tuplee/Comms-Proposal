Project Details
The first order of business is to meet with City officials and debrief on the current security posture of the organization. This will clearly define the scope of our EDR solution. During this we will gather any existing documentation available and create topology maps to fully understand the overall network structure. We will also collaborate with key personnel to define which assets and components will need to be included. 

Outlining Security Posture & Assessing Threat Categories
Once City officials have outlined their posture, the system will be assessed via vulnerability scanning to establish what vulnerabilities can be mitigated with the EDR solution and what vulnerabilities need to be addressed outside the EDR solution. 

After these vulnerabilities have been categorized, the EDR solution will be implemented alongside an employee training program that educates end-device users on the role they play securing the networks that they use. Vulnerabilities not resolved with the EDR solution will be addressed to City officials to clarify responsibilities and scope in order to further strengthen the security posture of the City. 

Implementing EDR/MDR Solution
After implementation, the EDR solution will develop its managed service by first developing the baseline of normal network behavior for end-devices, systems, and cloud applications. Telemetry from this data will be bundled into a dashboard that will leverage security platforms already in place in City infrastructure, creating a real-time analytics dashboard that can be accessed by City security officials and planners.
Offensive Security Measures to Enhance Network Defense

Cyberquack’s in-house Red Team specializes in offensive security testing enterprise-level networks and have a multitude of purpose-built tools that will continue to test the attack surface of the City of New Westminster’s networks. With regular meetings and reporting, this value-added service has the potential to stop threat actors and inform decision makers of priority concerns.

Defining Next-Generation EDR Technology & Proactive Security
Using Crowdstrike’s latest EDR innovation, the City of New Westminster can rest assured their networks have a guardian angel always watching over them. Crowdstrike’s Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration powers the EDR with real-time updates on modern tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and can identify the stealthiest of attackers, forwarding reports to those that need to know.

Project Team Breakdown
To complement the EDR solution, a management team of highly skilled network engineers, security analysts, and system administrators take security to the next level. Through our highly skilled management team, the EDR solution becomes an MDR solution that not only detects, but proactively hunts, investigates, and responds to emerging or advanced threats.
