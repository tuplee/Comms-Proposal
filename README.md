Aloha
  
  Here is a github where we can do version control for the proposal we are writing in Comms. 
  I thought it would be good practice pulling and writing commits to Github too.
  
  If you are working on a TO DO item please put your name or a comment directly after the asterisk, eg:
  
  * /HEY I AM WORKING ON THIS/ Particular section that needs work

  
  Please remember to list your sources either in commit comments or at the end of the file itself. 
  
  You can gain karma for the next life by converting them to citations yourself before listing. 
  Ideally we should be following the Heirarchy of Sources but you know.. one step at a time and all that..
  
  Currently using this app for citations:

  TO DO:
  * /tuplee will handle this/ Make Intro Section a bit more accessible to casual readers
  * Review Project Details section with James - are we detailed enough or are we too high level with it still?
  * Develop Schedule Section from Project Details section
  * Use Scheduling Section to build Gantt Chart
  * Develop budget outline (see LearningHub Week 5 Proposal-schedules-budgets.ppt)
  * Develop budget breakdown (see LearningHub Week 2 Proposal-Erfan-Nav & INCS Example for two diff approaches)
  * Build Budget Section
  * Develop ROI Section
  * Develop Summary Section
  * Develop Conclusion/Recommendation
  * Develop Letter of Transmittal

    Don't forget to clean up! Anyone is welcome to edit this file.

Aloha
