Aloha

Here is a github where we can do version control for the proposal we are writing in Comms. I thought it would be a good practice pulling and writing commits to Github too.

Each week we can create a new file for the section of the proposal and work on it together.

There's always the Discord too in case this turns out to be too much work.

Any resources you use writing for the particular file should go at the bottom of the file. 

Once the file has been edited and we have a final copy we can do formatting on a Word page and submit. 

We can add more things here that will help us through the project, I'm not sure what to write here just yet.

Aloha
