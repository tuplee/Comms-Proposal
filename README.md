Here is a github where we can do version control for the proposal we are writing in Comms. I thought it would be a good practice pulling and writing commits to Github too since actually doing coding on people's projects on this website is uhhhhh scary?

We can add more things here that will help us through the project, I'm not sure what to write here just yet.

Aloha
