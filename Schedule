PHASE 1
1) Debrief with City officials to understand current security posture and define scope of responsibility
2) Develop network topology diagrams (what other planning materials can be developed at this stage?)

PHASE 2
1) Active vulnerability scanning within scope
2) Categorize vulerabilities into EDR and non-EDR problems
3) Create document outlining vulnerability scan finds and next steps (don't actually make a real one, this is just something that should be included in the hypothetical reporting strategy)

PHASE 3 (Concurrent with PHASE 4)
1) Implement EDR solution (this step needs to be more specific than it's current general stance)
2) Develop baseline network behaviour patterns
3) Develop data telemetry pipelines to reporting and dashboard functions

PHASE 4 (Concurrent with PHASE 3)
1) Create internet-accessible dashboard that leverages EDR telemtry

PHASE 5 (Concurrent with PHASE 3&4)
1) Using 2.3, address vulnerabilities not solved by an EDR solution

PHASE 6
1) Red-Teaming phase (what are the main steps involved here, don't let this phase take up the majority of the schedule section space)
